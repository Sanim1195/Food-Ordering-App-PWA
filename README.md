# Food-Ordering-App-PWA
The contents in the file are in the master branch. 

In this project i have made a single page application using react and converted it into a Progressive Web application using google lighthouse and WorkBox.
The users can use this application to order food online as it tries to mimmic a real life website for a resturant where customers can order food onine.

I have used firebase as my database because it was quick to configure with the react application.

The project aslo offers a resturant view of the orders which mimmics the chef's side of the app where 
the chef's can complete the orderin the system when they finish preparing the food.
